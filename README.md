I am a person who is not afraid of challenges, can work under pressure and analyze well. Prefer to try and do things my self in order to understand them, but if needed wonâ€™t hesitate to ask colleagues for help. Like working in group and helping out. Could say that I am with a robust personality, a good listener who likes to further research the things that I am working on to understand them better.

Skills: Python / Basics (HTML / CSS)/ HTTP Basics

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
